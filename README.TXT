------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a program that plays a dice game.
The program accepts a die type, number of dice, and target number.

    Valid die types are:  4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100
    Max number of dice: 10
    Min & max target numbers: 5 & 30
    
   The game is played by rolling all the dice. Each die is a separate attempt at the target number with the following caveats:
   
    If more than 50% of the dice are ones, the result is a bust and the roll fails.
    If any of the results are the same as the die type, that individual result is open ended, and another dice is rolled and added to the first result. This can happen multiple times.
